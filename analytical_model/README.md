# Analytical Model

This is an analytical that tells the number of the cycles taken to finish a computation of a layer using PQA, and 2 conventional DLAs. It also contains the code needed to reproduce plots and results in the paper related to performance.

# Usage

The following assumes you're already inside the directory `analytical_model`.

You first need to install the requirements by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you can run the following command to reproduce the results in the paper:

```bash
./generate_plots.sh
```

A folder with the name `paper_plots` is created with the plots that are in the paper related to the performance. Another folder with the name `results` contains some extra results that you might find useful.

# Generating table 3

This table can be generated by running the notebook `print_comparison_table.ipynb`. Performance columns of the table will be saved into the file `comparison_table.csv`.
